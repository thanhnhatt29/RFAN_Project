# R For Analysis Project

- **Title**: An Analysis of Life Expectancy Using R

- **Objective**: The objective of this project is to use R to analyze a dataset of life expectancy data and identify the factors that are most correlated with life expectancy.

- **Data**: The data for this project will be obtained from the World Health Organization (WHO). The dataset contains life expectancy data for all countries in the world from 2000 to 2015.

- **Methods**: The methods that will be used in this project include data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and statistical modeling. Data cleaning will be performed to remove any errors or inconsistencies in the data. Exploratory data analysis will be used to visualize the data and identify any patterns or trends. Statistical modeling will be used to identify the factors that are most correlated with life expectancy.

- **Results**: The results of this project will be a report that summarizes the findings of the analysis. The report will include a description of the data, the methods that were used, and the results of the analysis.

- **Conclusion**: The conclusion of this project will discuss the implications of the findings and suggest areas for further research.
